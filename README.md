# Maze-Game

Created a maze game where a player must navigate their way through a preset maze.

Players are able to control the character using the keyboard, and the game does not allow the player to move through the wall/obstacles.

## Main Features:

1) Combines two programs
  - Moving a character with the keyboard
  - Drawing a maze
2) Expands on the combined program to include: 
  - Collisions between players and every wall
  - Restricts the players movements to the screen
3) Creates a winning conditions
  - The game prompts the player that they won, and ends
